\chapter{Meetings description}
\section{Meeting 1 \& 2 : 09/11/2022}
First group meetings for the uses cases. First of all we brainstormed to find the use cases from the client's request. Everyone proposed ideas, we wrote them down on a board and then we discussed together and precisely defined the use cases. Then, we realized that the initial topic was too limited compared to the number of uses cases requested, so we decided to change the topic and propose new features.

Once we found enough uses cases, we drew the global schema of the uses cases. The diagram was made by Lucas in plantUML. We then agreed that Richard would take care of the basic mock-ups and how to make them.

\section{Week-end 11-13/11/2022}
Each member of the group rated ( /5 ) the amount of work and the difficulty of each uses case. Then, we shared our results and we got a score for each uses case. Below is the table containing our scores and the final scores of the uses cases.

Then, we divided the uses cases. We calculated that each one had to choose uses cases to have a score of about six points. The allocation was done by affinity, each one chose what he wanted to do. Below the table of the distribution of the uses cases.

We had set ourselves the goal of finishing the description of the uses for the next session so that we could compare, ask our questions, etc...

\section{Meeting 3 : 16/11/2022}
Pooling of the use cases' description. We had a debriefing meeting with the teacher, which allowed us to ask our questions. Then we listed what we had to do and who had to do what by the next session. Richard showed us the basic mock-ups and the site (\href{https://www.figma.com}{Figma}) on which we could make our own.

\section{Meeting 4 : 18/11/2022}
The majority of the group completed their uses cases. We put them all in a document and, to make sure no one has forgotten any important points, each member of the group had to read over the uses cases of the others. We made adjustments, clarified certain aspects of the project, corrected spelling mistakes\dots\ Lucas took care of the layout on \LaTeX.

\chapter{Personnal impressions}
I enjoyed supervising the use case stage. I think the group got along well and there were no work or motivation problems. I found it difficult to "order" the team members around. I prefer to discuss with everyone and let everyone do what they want to do because I think that when one does what he/she wants to do, he/she is more motivated for his/her tasks.
